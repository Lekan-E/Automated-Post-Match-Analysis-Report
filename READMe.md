# Project: Post-Match Tactical Analysis of UEFA Euro 2024 Final
### Description:
I developed a comprehensive post-match tactical analysis report for the UEFA Euro 2024 Final between Spain and England. This project involved multiple stages of data processing, analysis, and visualization to provide detailed insights into the match dynamics and player performances.

### Tools & Technologies:
- Python: For data extraction and processing
- Pandas: For data filtering, aggregation, and sorting
- Microsoft Excel: For data export and sharing
- Tableau: For data visualization and report generation

### Steps Involved:
Data Extraction:
- Utilized Python to fetch match data from the Statsbomb API.
- Implemented automated scripts to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

Data Processing:
- Employed Pandas to clean and preprocess the data.
- Filtered relevant metrics such as player statistics, team performance indicators, and match events.
- Aggregated data to highlight key statistics and trends.
- Sorted data to identify top performers and crucial moments in the match.

Data Export:
- Exported the processed data into Excel files to facilitate further analysis and sharing.
- Structured the data in a user-friendly format, enabling easy interpretation of results.

Data Visualization:
- Created visualizations using Tableau to present the analysis in an engaging and insightful manner.
- Developed charts and graphs to depict match momentum, xG dynamics, player contributions, and team comparisons.
- Designed interactive dashboards to allow users to explore the data and gain deeper insights.

#### Outcome:
The final report provided a detailed tactical analysis of the match, including:
- A comprehensive overview of team performances.
- Player-specific metrics and comparisons.
- Visualization of key match events and turning points.
- Insights into strategic decisions and their impact on the game.

This project showcased my ability to handle end-to-end data analysis workflows, from data extraction and processing to visualization and reporting, using advanced tools and technologies.
